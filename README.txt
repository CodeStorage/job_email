This script sends emails to targets from a csv file for the purpose 
generating interest for personal employment. I intended for this
script to be for personal use and as an exercise in python programming.

There are two inputs to the program call: the first is the name of 
the data file, the second is the number of emails you wish to send.
The command should look something like this:
C:\[Path]> python job_email.py [filename] [number_send]
